    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who does not like a good dish out of a juicy chicken liver?</p>
    <p>You might even ask me: what can be better than a cooked liver?</p>
    <p>I will tell you: <strong>Liver Balls</strong>. Juicy and springy.</p>
    <p>These bad boys elevate the meaning of saying: "<em>Play with your food</em>" on whole other level.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kilogram of raw chicken liver</li>
        <li>2 cups of bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>0.25 cup of flour to whiten our paws</li>
        <li>
            <p>2 cups of our recently made chicken stock</p>
            <p>(Yummy <strong>and</strong> versatile)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Grind that liver in a food processor(<em>or with your claws</em>) until it's smooth.</li> 
       <li>Blend in bread crumbs, egg, and flour</li>
       <li>Bring chicken stock to a boil</li>
       <li>Using wet spoon, drop spoonfuls of our mix into a boiling chicken stock</li>
       <li>Simmer for 25-30 minutes</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Pro tip for cats only</strong>(Pesky humans should use their spoonies):</p>
    <p>Using spoons is hard. Especially if you have paws...</p>
    <p>Instead of spoon try using your mouth.</p>
    <p><strong>Resist to eat it right now</strong>! it will be better once it's cooked.</p>
