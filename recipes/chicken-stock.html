    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Life of a regular house Cat can be hard, indeed.</p>
    <p>Long days spent near the window trying to catch that pesky pigeon...</p>
    <p>Sleepless nights buried in the litterbox trying to hide that one poop that just doesn't want to go away...</p>
    <p>Yea... we all know that feeling. Feeling that you need a good break.</p>
    <p>And what's a better break than a bowl of refreshing homemade chicken stock?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kilogram of chicken bones, beaks, and feet</li>
        <li>1 large onion, if you are a fan of those smelly things</li>
        <li>2 big carrots</li>
        <li>6 cups of fresh water(preferably from the tap and not your bowl)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all the chicken stuff and vegetables into a large pot.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Add all the water that you've gathered.</p>
            <p>Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove chicken and vegetables. <strong>Don't throw them out</strong>.</p>
            <p>Humans love looking for things around the house,</p>
            <p>so let them have some fun! <em>Hide used ingredients around your place</em></p>
            <p>and watch those silly people run around trying to figure out where the smell is coming from</p>
        </li>
        <li>Strain stock. <strong>Do not skim fat of the surface under any circumstances</strong>. It is blasphemy.</li>
        
    </ol>
